This is a no-frills asset pipeline wrapper for the [String.js Javascript library][1].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'stringjs-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install stringjs-rails

## Usage

Or use the minified version:
